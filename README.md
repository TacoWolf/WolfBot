# WolfBot
A simple bot for Discord.

# Requirements

* Node.js

# Getting Started 

Clone the repository as normal. Download the packages needed by running

    npm install

Make a `config.json` from the [config.example.json](config.example.json) and then just run the bot with

    node bot.js
  
For now, you'll have to feed it servers manually by logging into them on the Discord Client. Administrators are set manually and are based on a user ID.

Keep the bot's libraries updated by using 

    npm update
